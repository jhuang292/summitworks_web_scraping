9,Q what is the differencebetween repeater and grid viewA GridView displays your data source in an HTML table and extends it to allow paging sorting editing etc
10, A repeater is a template control where you specify the html that is used to render each row
11, A gridview can only show your data in a table but a repeater can show your data in any way you want by creating the relevant ItemTemplate
12, for more detailshttpwww
13,html

19, A global temp table is accessible by all connected users
20,How do you declare a local temp table and a global temp tableCREATE TABLE localtemptablename
21, Uses one CREATE TABLE globaltemptablename
22, Uses two How are transactions usedBegin the transaction Commit the transaction if you want to save the changes Rollback the transaction if you want to undo the changes
23,Whats the difference between Truncate and DeleteTRUNCATEremoves all rows from a table but the table structure its columnsconstraints indexes and so on remains
24,You cannot use TRUNCATE TABLE on a tablereferenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint
25,DELETE removes rows one at a time and records anentry in the transaction log for each deleted row
26,Whats the difference between REST and SOAPREST can use different data formats but SOAP can only use XML
27, REST has to use HTTP but SOAP can use different protocols
28, REST is faster
29,REST uses the HTTP buildin headers with a variety of mediatypes to carry meta information and use the GET POST PUT and DELETE verbs to perform CRUD operations

34, The ones I rememberDifference between String and StringBuilderString is immutable which means that every time you assign a new value to a String object the system has to create an entirely new string
35, StringBuilder is a class designed to circumvent this problem
36,Difference between chr and asc I assumed it is a SQL questionCHR or CHAR is a character data type single character while ASC is Ascending used in ordering SQL queries

41,Does Angular use AJAX under the hoodFor the http service Angular uses AJAX
42,What is AJAXAjax is a clientside script that communicates to and from a serverdatabase without needing a postback or page refresh
43,What are the downsides to using stored proceduresModification of a stored procedure from its norm requires writing a new procedure or writing a unique query
44, SQL Server will optimize stored procedures when they are used frequently as well leading to an increase in performance
45,NET MVC Fullstack or partstackASP
46,NET MVC is fullstack which is the idea of having everything you need for a web application in one framework

57, When await is used within one of these functions it has the async function wait for a period of time
58,IQueryable vs IEnumerable Whats the differences Which executes queries immediatelyIQueryable is an extension of IEnumerable that is built specifically to deal with SQL queries

67, A view is a set of data combined from multiple tables or just a single table
68, It does not have to contain all of the data within the tables selected
69,Difference between a stored procedure and a functionA function must return a value while a stored procedure does not have to one of the many differences
