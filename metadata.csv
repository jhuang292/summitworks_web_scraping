Robert Meise,rf_meiseyahoo.com,,JPMC,172016,.NET,Q what is the differencebetween repeater and grid viewA GridView displays your data source in an HTML table and extends it to allow paging sorting editing etc. A repeater is a template control where you specify the html that is used to render each row. A gridview can only show your data in a table but a repeater can show your data in any way you want by creating the relevant ItemTemplate. For example you might show a list of products with each product having an image description list of colours price etc all arranged as youd normal see a product listing.  A repeater can supply that kind of display flexibility. for more detailshttpwww.dotnettricks.comTutorialaspnetK0KJ111013DifferenceBetweenRepeaterandDataListandGridView.html

CLICK MINE Osman Ahmed,,,Voya Financial their vendor though,312016,.NET,Before we get to the questions I would just like to say that Im rooting for you and you deserve to be happy.How would you reverse the order of an arrays elementWhats the port number of SQL Server1433.Whats the difference between a local temp table and a global temp tableA local temp table is accessible for one user connected to the database. A global temp table is accessible by all connected users.How do you declare a local temp table and a global temp tableCREATE TABLE localtemptablename... Uses one CREATE TABLE globaltemptablename... Uses two How are transactions usedBegin the transaction Commit the transaction if you want to save the changes Rollback the transaction if you want to undo the changes.Whats the difference between Truncate and DeleteTRUNCATEremoves all rows from a table but the table structure its columnsconstraints indexes and so on remains.You cannot use TRUNCATE TABLE on a tablereferenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint. Because TRUNCATE TABLE is not loggedit cannot activate a trigger.TRUNCATE is DDL Command.DELETE removes rows one at a time and records anentry in the transaction log for each deleted row.DELETE Can be used with or without a WHEREclause.DELETE is DML Command.
Osman Ahmed,,,Ramy InfoTech vendor,322016,.NET,The vendor just slipped in one random technical question for no reason.Whats the difference between REST and SOAPREST can use different data formats but SOAP can only use XML. REST has to use HTTP but SOAP can use different protocols. REST is faster. SOAP has endtoend reliability.The SOAP message consists of an envelope which includes SOAP headers and body to store the actual information you want to send.REST uses the HTTP buildin headers with a variety of mediatypes to carry meta information and use the GET POST PUT and DELETE verbs to perform CRUD operations. SOAP uses interfaces and named operations to expose your service. REST uses URI and methods like GET PUT POST DELETE to expose resources.
Osman Ahmed,,,Webster Bank Ramy InfoTech vendor,332016,.NET,Is there a way to catch exceptions for all your actions without using try catch in all your actionsSomething to do with HandleError.How would you save the last time a file in a virtual directory of images was accessed in a tableSomething to do with HTTP HandlerModules.

Michael Oelfke,msoelfkegmail.com,7325708584,SVAM International Vendor,382016,.NET,Asked me some information about my background. Asked me to describe myself. Then asked various technical questions. The ones I rememberDifference between String and StringBuilderString is immutable which means that every time you assign a new value to a String object the system has to create an entirely new string. StringBuilder is a class designed to circumvent this problem. As you add to the StringBuilder object it appends to the result instead of creating a new String object every time.Difference between chr and asc I assumed it is a SQL questionCHR or CHAR is a character data type single character while ASC is Ascending used in ordering SQL queries. I may have misunderstood the question it came after several SQL related questions.How do you link a stylesheet into a webpageltlink hrefwhatever relstylesheetgtDifference between to and to xIm not sure if I understood the interviewer properly. This question doesnt seem to make any sense as I cant find anything about this after the fact. I did not answer it during the interview either and no details were given. Maybe a trick questionIs String a reference type or a value typeReference type they are objects.
Michael Oelfke,msoelfkegmail.com,7325708584,Vendor,382016,.NET,What is SSIS and what is it used forSSIS stands for SQL Server Integration Services. It is used for hosting and configuring Web Applications on a home server.Does Angular use AJAX under the hoodFor the http service Angular uses AJAX.What is AJAXAjax is a clientside script that communicates to and from a serverdatabase without needing a postback or page refresh.What are the downsides to using stored proceduresModification of a stored procedure from its norm requires writing a new procedure or writing a unique query.What are the upsides to using stored proceduresCode reusability. You dont need to constantly rewrite stored procedures. SQL Server will optimize stored procedures when they are used frequently as well leading to an increase in performance.Is ASP.NET MVC Fullstack or partstackASP.NET MVC is fullstack which is the idea of having everything you need for a web application in one framework. A partstack framework requires an accompanying framework to handle the other sections of the application. For example AngularJS being only frontend is partstack.
Michael Oelfke,msoelfkegmail.com,7325708584,United Airlines,3102016,.NET,This interview was very long about 45 minutes. A lot of questions were asked and below are as many as I can remember.What are CSS Media QueriesMedia Queries is a module of CSS that defines expressions allowing to tailor presentations to a specific range of output devices without changing the content itself.What are the default number of columns in a Bootstrap application12.Why do you care about the columns in a Bootstrap applicationBootstrap columns are used to format an applications display based on the size of the screen. For example an item on a smaller screen could take 12 columns while an item on a larger screen could only take 4 or 6 thus changing the view depending on the screen size.When connecting to a database via LINQ is the data queried immediatelyNo. It is only queried once the data is used or transformed for example with ToList.What is the Option verb in an HTTP callIt is used in an HTTP call to set some options. I did not answer this question.What are AngularJS FiltersAngularJS Filters are customization options that can be set on datasets. They are used to filter out data from a dataset. The filter can simply be a link to a variable field or a function that performs some truefalse result operation.What is scopescope is a connection between the view and controller in Angular. It is used with Angular expressions to show data in the view.What is rootScoperootScope is the parent object of all scopes. It can be used as a global of sorts as any scope that is defined automatically inherits from scope and as a result has access to everything in rootScope.What are await and asyncUsed in multithreading a function defined as async is allowed to run outside and independently of the main application thread. When await is used within one of these functions it has the async function wait for a period of time.IQueryable vs IEnumerable Whats the differences Which executes queries immediatelyIQueryable is an extension of IEnumerable that is built specifically to deal with SQL queries. IEnumerable executes queries immediately as it does not make use of SQL features.What happens when you broadcast to rootScopeThe broadcast gets sent to all scopes.How do you handle events in AngularJSYou use the .on function. For example element.onclick functionHow do you handle an outside domain connectionNot sure did not answer this question.What is this in JavaScriptThe this keyword is used to refer to the owner of what is using it. For example in a function within an object the this keyword refers to the object that owns the function.How do you check that your Session is valid when conversing between multiple databasesNo idea. I did not answer this question it seemed like they didnt expect me to be able to.What is a directive and what is similar to a directive in ASP.NETA directive is an HTML helper that is used to provide some sort of function within a page. They are similar to ASP.NET User Controls.Difference between a table and a viewA table is a set of data within your database. A view is a set of data combined from multiple tables or just a single table. It does not have to contain all of the data within the tables selected.Difference between a stored procedure and a functionA function must return a value while a stored procedure does not have to one of the many differences.What is the lifetime of a temporary variableThe session. When the connection is closed or dropped the temporary variable is destroyed.Do you use a temp table or a temp variable Which is betterIt depends on the scenario. For example in a function you must use a temp table variable.How did you deploy a previous projectCreated a NodeJS package and used it to deploy multiple options are available this is the one Im most familiar with.

Explain more in detail using Hibernate to set user roles and the relationships they had Answer Inside the User class you had a Hashset storing User Roles with a One To Many Relationship annotating the set User roles method. Inside the UserRoles class you have a reference to the user as well as ManyToOne annotation on the set User method. For more information on how to answer this question please see this link and take a look at the model classeshttpwww.mkyong.comspringsecurityspringsecurityhibernateannotationexampleWhat is the difference between List and Set Answer List is ordered and can store duplicate values set is unordered and cannot store duplicate values.What is a directive What do you do in a directive in AngularJS Answer DOM manipulation is done in directive  for more information read Angular documentation on directives it is very well written and easy to understand. These are some of the questions that I remember from the interview.

Qi Xu,,,coding test,7232018,PYTHON,War Game War is a card game designed for two players utilizing a standard French style 52card deck of playingcards. The objective is to capture all the cards in the game before your opponent. Gameplay All cards are shuffled and then divided equally to each player in face down stacks one stack for each player. Each player reveals the top card of their deck simultaneously with the player revealing the highestranking card winning that particular round and thusly capturing their opponents card in addition to retaining their card. Both cards are then returned to the roundwinners deck placed face down at the bottom. Gameplay continues in the above fashion with players playing out consecutive rounds until one player runs out of cards and loses. Rankings Cards are ranked by face value with Ace King Queen and Jack each in order taking the highest ranking followed by number cards in numerical order 10 being worth more than a 9 etc.. Output must show face value and suite of the card. Ties In the event of a tie in a round  two players playing the same ranked cards  both cards are left face up between the two players and play proceeds to the next round. The winner of the next round takes all cards from the current as well as previous round. Challenge Your challenge is to write an application to simulate a game of War. Play out a game in full and output the winner. Additionally outputting the results of each round including the card that each player played as well as the verdict of which player won. If no winner exists after 100 rounds the game ends with a prompt to play chess instead.
