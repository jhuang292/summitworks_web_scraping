      "Q: what is the difference between repeater and grid view?A GridView displays your data source in an HTML table and extends it to allow paging, sorting, editing etc. A repeater is a template control, where you specify the html that is used to render each row. A gridview can only show your data in a table, but a repeater can show your data in any way you want by creating the relevant ItemTemplate. For example you might show a list of products, with each product having an image, description, list of colours, price etc, all arranged as you'd normal see a product listing.  A repeater can supply that kind of display flexibility. for more details:http://www.dotnet-tricks.com/Tutorial/aspnet/K0KJ111013-Difference-Between-Repeater-and-DataList-and-GridView.html\n",

Because TRUNCATE TABLE is not logged,it cannot activate a trigger. TRUNCATE is DDL Command.DELETE removes rows one at a time and records anentry in the transaction log for each deleted row. DELETE Can be used with or without a WHEREclause.   DELETE is DML Command.\n",

      "The vendor just slipped in one random technical question for no reason.What's the difference between REST and SOAP?REST can use different data formats but SOAP can only use XML. REST has to use HTTP but SOAP can use different protocols. REST is faster. SOAP has end-to-end reliability. The SOAP message consists of an envelope which includes SOAP headers and body to store the actual information you want to send. REST uses the HTTP build-in headers (with a variety of media-types) to carry meta information and use the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE verbs to perform CRUD operations. SOAP uses interfaces and named operations to expose your service. REST uses URI and methods like (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) to expose resources.\n",

The ones I remember:Difference between String and StringBuilder?String is immutable, which means that every time you assign a new value to a String object, the system has to create an entirely new string. StringBuilder is a class designed to circumvent this problem. As you add to the StringBuilder object, it appends to the result instead of creating a new String object every time.Difference between chr and asc (I assumed it is a SQL question)?CHR or CHAR is a character data type (single character), while ASC is Ascending, used in ordering SQL queries. I may have misunderstood the question, it came after several SQL related questions.How do you link a stylesheet into a webpage?<link href=\"whatever\" rel=\"stylesheet\"/>Difference between to and to x?I'm not sure if I understood the interviewer properly. This question doesn't seem to make any sense, as I can't find anything about this after the fact. I did not answer it during the interview, either, and no details were given. Maybe a trick question?Is String a reference type or a value type?Reference type, they are objects.\n",

You don't need to constantly rewrite stored procedures. SQL Server will optimize stored procedures when they are used frequently, as well, leading to an increase in performance.Is ASP.NET MVC Full-stack or part-stack?ASP.NET MVC is full-stack, which is the idea of having everything you need for a web application in one framework. A part-stack framework requires an accompanying framework to handle the other sections of the application. For example, AngularJS, being only front-end, is part-stack.\n",

A lot of questions were asked, and below are as many as I can remember.What are CSS Media Queries?Media Queries is a module of CSS that defines expressions allowing to tailor presentations to a specific range of output devices without changing the content itself.What are the default number of columns in a Bootstrap application?12.Why do you care about the columns in a Bootstrap application?Bootstrap columns are used to format an application's display based on the size of the screen. For example, an item on a smaller screen could take 12 columns while an item on a larger screen could only take 4 or 6, thus changing the view depending on the screen size.When connecting to a database via LINQ, is the data queried immediately?No. It is only queried once the data is used, or transformed (for example with ToList()).What is the Option verb in an HTTP call?It is used in an HTTP call to set some options. I did not answer this question.What are AngularJS Filters?AngularJS Filters are customization options that can be set on data-sets. They are used to filter out data from a data-set. The filter can simply be a link to a variable field, or a function that performs some true/false result operation.What is $scope?$scope is a connection between the view and controller in Angular. It is used with Angular expressions to show data in the view.What is $rootScope?$rootScope is the parent object of all $scopes. It can be used as a global of sorts, as any $scope that is defined automatically inherits from $scope, and as a result has access to everything in $rootScope.What are await and async?Used in multi-threading, a function defined as async is allowed to run outside and independently of the main application thread. When await is used within one of these functions, it has the async function wait for a period of time.IQueryable vs IEnumerable? What's the differences? Which executes queries immediately?IQueryable is an extension of IEnumerable that is built specifically to deal with SQL queries. IEnumerable executes queries immediately as it does not make use of SQL features.What happens when you broadcast to $rootScope?The broadcast gets sent to all $scopes.How do you handle events in AngularJS?You use the .on function. For example, element.on('click', function(){});How do you handle an outside domain connection?Not sure, did not answer this question.What is this in JavaScript?The this keyword is used to refer to the owner of what is using it. For example, in a function within an object, the this keyword refers to the object that owns the function.How do you check that your Session is valid when conversing between multiple databases?No idea. I did not answer this question (it seemed like they didn't expect me to be able to).What is a directive, and what is similar to a directive in ASP.NET?A directive is an HTML helper that is used to provide some sort of function within a page. They are similar to ASP.NET User Controls.Difference between a table and a view?A table is a set of data within your database. A view is a set of data combined from multiple tables, or just a single table. It does not have to contain all of the data within the tables selected.Difference between a stored procedure and a function?A function must return a value while a stored procedure does not have to (one of the many differences).What is the lifetime of a temporary variable?The session. When the connection is closed or dropped, the temporary variable is destroyed.Do you use a temp table or a temp variable? Which is better?It depends on the scenario. For example, in a function, you must use a temp table variable.How did you deploy a previous project?Created a NodeJS package and used it to deploy (multiple options are available, this is the one I'm most familiar with).\n",

Answer: loose coupling is key word, as soon as I said loose coupling he was satisfied. Explain Spring MVCHow can you return a String in a controller?  Answer: use @ResponseBody annotationExplain an example when you used Hibernate to set user roles?  Answer: One table to hold users, one table to hold user roles, the user roles table had a foreign key pointing to the primary key in the Users table.  Explain more in detail using Hibernate to set user roles and the relationships they had?  Answer: Inside the User class, you had a Hashset storing User Roles with a One To Many Relationship annotating the set User roles method.  Inside the UserRoles class, you have a reference to the user as well as @ManyToOne annotation on the set User method.  For more information on how to answer this question, please see this link and take a look at the model classes: http://www.mkyong.com/spring-security/spring-security-hibernate-annotation-example/What is the difference between List and Set?  Answer: List is ordered and can store duplicate values, set is unordered and cannot store duplicate values.What is a directive?  What do you do in a directive in AngularJS?  Answer: DOM manipulation is done in directive - for more information, read Angular documentation on directives, it is very well written and easy to understand.  These are some of the questions that I remember from the interview.  \n",

      "# ***War Game***# War is a card game designed for two players, utilizing a standard (French style) 52-card deck of playing-cards. The objective is to \"capture\" all the cards in the game before your opponent.# *Gameplay*# All cards are shuffled, and then divided equally to each player in face down stacks (one stack for each player). Each player reveals the top card of their deck simultaneously, with the player revealing the highest-ranking card winning that particular round and thusly \"capturing\" their opponent's card (in addition to retaining their card). Both cards are then returned to the round-winner's deck, placed face down at the bottom. Gameplay continues in the above fashion, with players playing out consecutive rounds, until one player runs out of cards and loses.# *Rankings*# Cards are ranked by face value, with Ace, King, Queen, and Jack each (in order) taking the highest ranking, followed by number cards in numerical order (10 being worth more than a 9, etc.). Output must show face value and suite of the card.# *Ties*# In the event of a tie in a round - two players playing the same ranked cards - both cards are left face up between the two players, and play proceeds to the next round. The winner of the next round takes all cards from the current as well as previous round.# *Challenge*# Your challenge is to write an application to simulate a game of War. Play out a game in full, and output the winner. Additionally, outputting the results of each round, including the card that each player played as well as the verdict of which player won. If no winner exists after 100 rounds, the game ends with a prompt to play chess instead.\n",
