What are the core classes in hibernate
Explain the spring MVC architectureWhat are some commonly used spring MVC annotations
Types of controller classes in spring
Have you participated in code reviews what did you do what are best practices
Explain Spring MVCHow can you return a String in a controller Answer use ResponseBody annotationExplain an example when you used Hibernate to set user roles Answer One table to hold users one table to hold user roles the user roles table had a foreign key pointing to the primary key in the Users table
 Explain more in detail using Hibernate to set user roles and the relationships they had Answer Inside the User class you had a Hashset storing User Roles with a One To Many Relationship annotating the set User roles method
 Inside the UserRoles class you have a reference to the user as well as ManyToOne annotation on the set User method

ØCan you talk about the company with which yourecently worked withØWhat is normalizationØWhich methodology did you work in Explain it is a free and open source static code analysis tool used insoftware development for checking whether Java code conforms to the codingconventions you have established
is a static code analysis tool that iscapable to automatically detect a wide range of potential bugs and unsafe ornonoptimized code
is an open sourceJava code quality tool similar in some ways to Checkstyle and PMD but with aquite different focus
In fact it concentrates on detecting potentialbugs and performance issues and does a very good job of detecting a variety ofmany types of common hardtofind coding mistakes including threadsynchronization problems null pointer dereferences infinite recursive loopsmisuse of API methods etc
 FindBugs operates on Java bytecode rather thansource code
